Using a physics engine called Box2D I created a prgram which simulates accurate collisions between seperate objects and between the objects and their enviroment. 

There are a number of static platforms and a terrain is generated at the bottom of the window, Perlin noise is used to craft the terrain and is different each time the code is compiled.

The user can place square objects either by clicking or holding down the right mouse button inside the window.
